            <h2>Welcome to My Hobby Page</h2>
            <p> I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me active and entertained. From walking to volleyball, badminton, watching the sunset, and reading books, each hobby brings joy and helps improve my mood. Many of these activities involve being with people. It took me some time to find hobbies that I truly enjoy. I discovered my love for the outdoors when I was young, which led me to fill my free time mostly with outdoor activities. These hobbies not only keep me physically active but also provide a sense of peace and fulfillment.            </p>
