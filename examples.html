                        <p>Playing volleyball is my favorite hobby because it keeps me active and lets me spend quality time with friends. I love the teamwork and excitement of the game, and it helps me stay fit and energized. Volleyball was the first sport I learned to play, and it holds a special place in my heart because of the fun memories and friendships I've built through it.

<p>Badminton is one of my favorite hobbies because it's a great way to improve attention and speed. It's my go-to game for fun and fitness, and I always keep a racket handy for free time with my siblings. It's easy to learn, making it perfect for everyone to join in and enjoy.

                        <p>Watching the sunset is one of my favorite hobbies because it’s a calming and beautiful experience. It gives me peace to watch the colors change in the sky, and I have a lot of sunset pictures capturing those moments. I get to watch it at work every day because of my schedule, and I time my lunch to enjoy a drink while watching the sunset.

                        <p>Reading books is one of my favorite hobbies because it’s a wonderful way to relax and learn new things. I often read before I sleep, and I especially enjoy fiction. Right now, I'm reading Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi. The book is about a small café in Tokyo where customers can travel back in time, but only for the duration of their coffee.
